  Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Power BI
•	Microsoft Excel (for preprocessing)
•	DAX (for calculated fields & KPIs)

  Dataset Used:
The dataset contains detailed e-commerce sales records including fields such as Order ID, Customer Name, Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity Sold, Payment Mode, Product Category, Sub-category, and State-wise sales. The data was cleaned and structured before import.

  Methodology / Workflow:
•	Data Cleaning & Formatting in Excel
•	Import and Modelling in Power BI
•	Data Transformation using Power Query
•	Creation of KPIs and calculated metrics
•	Dashboard design with filters, charts, and visuals
•	Insight generation and validation

  Key Features & Visuals in Dashboard:
•	KPI Cards: Total Sales, Quantity Sold, Total Profit, Average Order Value
•	Profit by Month (Bar Chart)
•	Sales by State (Horizontal Bar Chart)
•	Sales by Customer (Bar Chart)
•	Profit by Sub-Category (Bar Chart)
•	Payment Mode Distribution (Donut Chart)
•	Quantity Sold by Category (Donut Chart)
•	Quarters-based Filter for dynamic analysis

  Results / Key Insights:
•	Highest profit recorded in December
•	West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Gujarat lead in state-wise sales
•	Home Appliances and Apparel contribute major profits
•	Cash on Delivery and Credit Card are top payment modes
•	Beauty and Sports categories show highest quantities sold

  Challenges Faced:
•	Handled missing and duplicate values during preprocessing
•	Aligned multiple fields for accurate data modelling and visualization

  Conclusion:
The E-commerce Sales Dashboard project provided valuable practical experience in transforming raw business data into meaningful visual insights using Power BI. By working with sales, profit, customer, and product data, the dashboard successfully highlighted key business metrics and trends that support data-driven decisions. Visual elements such as KPI cards, bar charts, and donut charts helped analyse total revenue, profit distribution, state-wise performance, customer contributions, and payment preferences.
The project strengthened my understanding of data preparation, Power Query transformations, and DAX calculations. It also improved my ability to organize dashboards with clarity, usability, and professional visual design. Insights such as December being the most profitable month, West Bengal and Maharashtra leading in sales, and high demand for beauty and sports categories helped demonstrate the practical value of analytics.
This project not only enhanced my technical skills in Power BI but also improved my analytical thinking and presentation abilities. Overall, it provided a strong foundation in business intelligence and dashboard creation, preparing me to apply similar techniques in real-world scenarios.
